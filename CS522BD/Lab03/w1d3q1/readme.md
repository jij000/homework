# Question 1
## Create a Java simulator for WordCount with In mapper combining.
1. Create a InMapperWordCount class. You should be able to specify the number of Input-splits (the same as the number of Mappers) and the number of reducers.
2. You have already created the Mapper class. (See W1D1). Just modify it appropriately. Rest is as in W1D2. (No need to modify W1D2)
3. Add necessary output statements so that your output matches one shown in the attached file “InMapperTestDataOutput”.
