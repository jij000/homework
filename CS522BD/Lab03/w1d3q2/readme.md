# Question 2
## Create a Java simulator to compute the average length words beginning with the same letter.
For example, if the file {Addison ate a red apple} will produce two key-value pairs: 

< a, 4.0 >               // 16 = 7 + 3 + 1 + 5 16/4 = 4.0

< r, 3.0 >                  // 3    3/1 = 3.0

Number of Mappers: 4
Number of Reducers: 3
Please use the same getPartition method.
